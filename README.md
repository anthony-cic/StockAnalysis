A basic stock analyis program that showcases information related to any ticker. 

Currently, the program shows if the stock's free cash flow and revenue is increasing year by year.
It also prints out the EPS and PE ratio which was calculated using the Diluted EPS. 

This program is not meant for financial advise, more so a showcase of some of my fintech skills as well as my opinion on the value of a stock. 

Of course, there is so much more that goes into a stock than just what is showcased here. Things like news, leadership, and expectations play a HUGE 
factor in a stocks value.
